##Code Style
* Please avoid any unnecessary changes eg. spacing, line endings, HTML formatting. Remember, these files are NOT for human consumption. We want to preserve meaningful history.
* Please try to match existing style for any particular file - formatting, spacing, naming conventions.
* Please add corresponding @since tags

##Types of contribution
We don't really want to include all possible extension/libs ASAP (they do slow the IDE down a bit) and we are working on a better system for managing them. **Until we find good solution we'll prioritise bugfixes**.
